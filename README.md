# Ledn Token Interview Challenge

At Ledn, we are eager to find talented, resourceful, and passionate engineers to help us build the future of digital asset financial services. In light of this, we created a series of steps for us to know each other. One of these is a take home challenge, which will take a few hours to complete.

### Why a take-home challenge?

In-person coding interviews can be stressful and may hide your full potential. A take-home gives you a chance to work in a less stressful environment and showcase your talent.

### Our tech stack

As outlined in our job description, we use the following technologies: TypeScript, React, styled-components, Redux and Jest.

### Challenge Background

We love Star Wars! Who doesn't love Star Wars!? We would like to know more about its planets.

Help us create a dashboard using the data from `planets-ui.json` to better visualize Star Wars's planets.

### Technical requirements

1. You need to create a frontend only web application displaying a list of planet cards using the json mentioned above.
2. Each card should contain the following data:

   - `name`
   - `terrain`
   - `climate`
   - `population`
   - `residents` (Number of known residents)

3. The data needs to be filterable and sortable as follows:
   - The user should be able to filter by `name` using a text field.
   - The user should be able to filter by `climate` using a dropdown field.
   - The user should be able to filter by `terrain` using a multiselect dropdown field.
   - The user should be able to sort data by `name`, `population` and `residents`.

Bonus.

1. Are you part of the dark side and cannot live without a dark theme? Let's make it!
2. Are you an old master that cannot process 60 planets at once? Let's add a pagination to remove noise from the Dashboard!

### Challenge requirements

1. Avoid UI libraries as much as possible and implement your own utilities, styles and UI components.
   - For example, we want the filter components implemented from scratch.
   - Copying in totality or partially a library such as Tailwind is considered as using a UI library.
2. Know that a cleaner and high quality submission is worth more than a feature complete, but messy one.
3. Remember that as front end developers, UIs are an integral part of our lives and good-looking UI is as important as a well functioning one.
4. Try to treat this as the base for an enterprise application. How do you setup state, business logic and code structure in your ideal application?
5. Feel free to choose any React stack that can accomplish these requirements.
6. Have fun and get creative!

### Submission

1. Please host your code repository on Github and make it private.
2. Invite Ledn-Reviewer to your project once it is ready.
3. Email Ashley: confirmation that Ledn-Reviewer has been added as a contributor and your project is ready for review.
4. Please include instructions on running your solution locally.
5. Please include a screen capture of your solution, so we can assess whether there is UI differences between your environment and ours.

### Following Steps

Upon submission of the challenge, we will review your code and reach out to you with comments. If your submission passes our criteria, a following interview will be scheduled to discuss your implementation in further detail. We feel this is another great way to assess your understanding rather than on the spot coding exercises!

We want you to succeed as much as you do, so we wish you the best of luck! Looking forward to your submission!
